# Autonomous Handoff

Last updated: 2026-05-14

## Current Branch

- `codex-product-engagement-pass`

## Completed and Committed

- Product v2 rules and methodology:
  - user-defined issue alignment is allowed
  - prescriptive voting advice remains prohibited
  - alignment must be evidence-based and non-ranking
- Product v2 tasklist:
  - `docs/product_v2_tasklist.md`
- Evidence drilldown:
  - backend endpoint for legislator/domain vote evidence
  - frontend evidence panel under Position by Issue
- Vote interpretation foundation:
  - `vote_interpretations` migration
  - deterministic `interpretation_v1`
  - ETL seed persistence
- Issue preference picker:
  - client-side issue selection and stance capture
- Alignment:
  - backend alignment endpoint
  - frontend alignment read
  - alignment cards link to vote evidence
- Comparison reframe:
  - committed as `fff81f8 Reframe comparison around selected issues`
  - comparison accepts the same issue preferences used by the alignment panel
  - both comparison sides show a `Your Issues` aligned/not-aligned/mixed/insufficient count
- Alignment state polish:
  - committed as `1e88a90 Polish alignment states`
  - preference picker no longer shows build-stage copy
  - alignment panel includes idle, loading, empty, mixed, and insufficient-evidence states
- Quick-read evidence links:
  - committed as `460db51 Link quick read to evidence`
  - quick-read domain and vote-direction cards can open underlying vote evidence
- Verification workflow docs:
  - committed as `084cfda Document verification workflow`
  - fixture/Supabase verification modes and Windows Next cache reset are documented
- Coverage metadata:
  - committed as `ab5f856 Surface coverage metadata`
  - `/metadata/coverage` returns source, window, counts, and source-link share
  - hero displays coverage window, loaded legislators, eligible roll calls, and source-link coverage
- Comparison context:
  - committed as `8d7026c Demote generic comparison context`
  - selected issue alignment remains primary; generic comparison reads are supporting context
- Loaded ZIP coverage:
  - committed as `2e66017 Expose loaded ZIP coverage`
  - `/lookup/zips` exposes database or fixture ZIP mappings for UI suggestions

## Active Checkpoint

Checkpoint target: `Document production deployment`.

Files in this checkpoint:

- `README.md`
- `docs/deployment.md`
- `docs/product_v2_tasklist.md`
- `docs/autonomous_handoff.md`

Intent of current changes:

- document Render backend deployment
- document Vercel frontend deployment
- record CORS, env vars, post-deploy checks, and cost notes

## Verification Already Run

Latest checks:

```powershell
$env:DATABASE_URL='postgresql://invalid'; pytest tests\test_api_alignment.py tests\test_api_compare.py
npm run build
$env:DATABASE_URL='postgresql://invalid'; pytest tests\test_api_metadata.py tests\test_api_lookup.py
```

Reported results:

- `10 passed`
- frontend build passed
- `$env:DATABASE_URL='postgresql://invalid'; pytest tests\test_api_metadata.py tests\test_api_lookup.py` passed (`6 passed`)
- `cd frontend; npm run build` passed
- browser smoke test attempted, but the in-app browser blocked `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` and `http://localhost:3000/` with `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`

Current checkpoint still needs verification:

- docs-only checkpoint; no build required

If the dev server is running and the browser looks stale, clear the Next cache before refresh:

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
Remove-Item -LiteralPath frontend\.next -Recurse -Force
Start-Process -FilePath npx.cmd -ArgumentList 'next','dev','-H','127.0.0.1','-p','3000' -WorkingDirectory '<repo>\frontend' -WindowStyle Hidden
```

## Next Product Tasks After Commit

Work from `docs/product_v2_tasklist.md` in this order:

1. Add accessibility and mobile layout checks for the full voter journey.
2. Add lightweight error monitoring guidance.

## Operating Mode

- Batch 2-4 related changes per checkpoint.
- Prefer targeted tests during development.
- Run full frontend build before UI commits.
- Avoid browser automation unless visual behavior is uncertain.
- Keep this file updated before stopping if work is incomplete.
